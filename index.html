<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quamvis enim depravatae non sint, pravae tamen esse possunt. Ita multo sanguine profuso in laetitia et in victoria est mortuus. Si enim ad populum me vocas, eum. Illa sunt similia: hebes acies est cuipiam oculorum, corpore alius senescit; </p>
<p>Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Non est ista, inquam, Piso, magna dissensio. Neque solum ea communia, verum etiam paria esse dixerunt. Tu enim ista lenius, hic Stoicorum more nos vexat. Saepe ab Aristotele, a Theophrasto mirabiliter est laudata per se ipsa rerum scientia; Dolor ergo, id est summum malum, metuetur semper, etiamsi non aderit; Iam in altera philosophiae parte. Quid enim me prohiberet Epicureum esse, si probarem, quae ille diceret? Qui non moveatur et offensione turpitudinis et comprobatione honestatis? An hoc usque quaque, aliter in vita? </p>
<p>Eam tum adesse, cum dolor omnis absit; Gerendus est mos, modo recte sentiat. Ipse Epicurus fortasse redderet, ut Sextus Peducaeus, Sex. Suo enim quisque studio maxime ducitur. Si id dicis, vicimus. Bonum incolumis acies: misera caecitas. </p>
<p>Omnis enim est natura diligens sui. Itaque primos congressus copulationesque et consuetudinum instituendarum voluntates fieri propter voluptatem; Cum ageremus, inquit, vitae beatum et eundem supremum diem, scribebamus haec. Huius, Lyco, oratione locuples, rebus ipsis ielunior. Etenim nec iustitia nec amicitia esse omnino poterunt, nisi ipsae per se expetuntur. Omnes enim iucundum motum, quo sensus hilaretur. Nec vero sum nescius esse utilitatem in historia, non modo voluptatem. Expressa vero in iis aetatibus, quae iam confirmatae sunt. </p>
<p>Tum Triarius: Posthac quidem, inquit, audacius. Quis est tam dissimile homini. Idcirco enim non desideraret, quia, quod dolore caret, id in voluptate est. Ita enim vivunt quidam, ut eorum vita refellatur oratio. </p>

The cool, calm, clarity that this sign exudes is why the symbol of the Maiden was chosen. Virgo people are mild mannered on the surface, but underneath there is a flurry of activity. Their minds are never quiet; always thinking, calculating, assessing. They loves making something out of nothing, nurturing and growing small things. They tend to be extremely detail oriented and particularly like producing something that is not only useful, but beautiful and skillful.
Virgo don’t mind being alone as long as they know that they are appreciated and needed. They are sympathetic listeners, and are ready to help out those in need. Their good nature often makes them easy to take advantage of, and often they end up taking on more jobs and tasks than they should. This sign would do well to carefully consider the situation and the task before agreeing to take it on.
Virgo is an Earth sign which means that they love making something from the land with their own hands. They do not tend to be loud or bossy, but are brilliant strategists and an asset to any team. Very often they will overburden themselves and take on more than they should, which makes their work suffer.
Upside: Virgo have a heart for their fellow man. They are kind, patient and love to laugh. They are not loud ‘look at me’ signs, but rather prefer to be the strong, silent type. They are creative thinkers and true family oriented people. Male Virgo, once they are committed to relationship never walk away (unless there is a betrayal, and even then it isn’t written in stone). Female Virgo are dedicated parents, often parenting other children in the neighborhood.
Downside: Virgo are particularly attentive to health; theirs, yours, everyone’s, which can often lead to obsessive behaviors toward health (hypochondria). They can also be judgmental and critical of those that they feel are not living up to their potential, or are going about a project in an inefficient way. Virgo are opinionated and have no problem sharing their opinions, even when they should not.
Virgo is an earth sign, like Taurus and Capricorn.
